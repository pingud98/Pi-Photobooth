# The Pi Photobooth

![](photobooth.png)

This project is based off the All Seeing Pi project by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

In general, the changes/additions I made to the changes that were made by @mdegrazia were:

1) removed the audio
2) removed the wii functions

3) added an on screen button to take photos
4) removed the GPIO functions for buttons
5) killed the kill button functionality
